                <h3>Who is Tolkien?</h3>
                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major philologist of the English language, specialising
                    in Old and Middle English. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of
                    Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within
                    the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of
                    Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close
                    friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was
                    appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.</p>
                <p> He also wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the
                    Rings (1954–1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world which he
                    called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves,
                    Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. </p>
                <p>After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's
                    extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The
                    Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories,
                    invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it,
                    Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of
                    these writings.</p>

                <h3>Childhood and Youth:</h3>
                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later
                    annexed by the British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa). His father
                    was Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his mother was Mabel, née
                    Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein
                    office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary
                    Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.</p>
                <p>The name “Tolkien” (pron.: Tol-keen; equal stress on both syllables) was believed by the family
                    (including Tolkien himself) to be of German origin; Toll-kühn: foolishly brave, or stupidly
                    clever—hence the pseudonym “Oxymore” which he occasionally used; however, this quite probably was a
                    German rationalisation of an originally Baltic Tolkyn, or Tolkīn.</p>
                <p>As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have
                    been later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special
                    hatred of spiders as an adult.</p>
                <p>When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a
                    lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could
                    join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her
                    parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall
                    Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring
                    Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire
                    scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and
                    Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his
                    fiction.</p>
                <p>Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen
                    pupil.[15] She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and
                    feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were
                    those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.</p>
                <p>Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her
                    Baptist family, <u>which stopped all financial assistance to her</u>. From then on, both Ronald and
                    Hilary remained devout Catholics throughout their lives. Mabel Tolkien assigned the guardianship
                    of her sons to her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was
                    assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien
                    recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class
                    Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was not. I first
                    learned charity and forgiveness from him.</p>
                <p>Tolkien family life was generally lived on the genteel side of poverty. However, the situation
                    worsened in 1904, when his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal; J.R.R.Tolkien
                    was 12. After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham
                    and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St Philip's School. In 1903, he won a
                    Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's.</p>
                <p>By this time Ronald was already showing remarkable linguistic gifts. He had mastered the Latin and
                    Greek which was the staple fare of an arts education at that time, and was becoming more than
                    competent in a number of other languages, both modern and ancient, notably Gothic, and later
                    Finnish. He was already busy making up his own languages, purely for fun. He had also made a number
                    of close friends at King Edward’s; Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and Christopher Wiseman;
                    together they formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club
                    and Barrovian Society, named after their meeting place at the Barrow Stores) and they continued to
                    correspond closely and exchange and criticise each other’s literary work until 1916.</p>
                <p>Amongst the lodgers at Mrs Faulkner’s boarding house was a young woman called Edith Bratt. When
                    Ronald was 16, and she 19, they struck up a friendship, which gradually deepened. Eventually Father
                    Francis took a hand, and forbade Ronald to see or even correspond with Edith for three years, until
                    he was 21. Ronald stoically obeyed this injunction to the letter.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1911, he was invited to join a party on a walking holiday in Switzerland, which may
                    have inspired his descriptions of the Misty Mountains, and of Rivendell.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of that year he went up to Exeter College, Oxford where he stayed, immersing himself in
                    the Classics, Old English, the Germanic languages (especially Gothic), Welsh and Finnish, until
                    1913, when he swiftly though not without difficulty picked up the threads of his relationship with
                    Edith. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile the relationship with Edith was going more smoothly. She converted to Catholicism and moved
                    to Warwick, which with its spectacular castle and beautiful surrounding countryside made a great
                    impression on Ronald. However, as the pair were becoming ever closer, the nations were striving ever
                    more furiously together, and war eventually broke out in August 1914.</p>

                <h3>The Great War:</h3>
                <p>Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Tolkien did not rush to join up immediately on the outbreak of
                    war, but returned to Oxford, where he worked hard and finally achieved a first-class degree in June
                    1915. At this time he was also working on various poetic attempts, and on his invented languages,
                    especially one that he came to call Qenya [sic], which was heavily influenced by Finnish—but he
                    still felt the lack of a connecting thread to bring his vivid but disparate imaginings together.</p>
                <p>Tolkien finally enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers whilst working on ideas
                    of Earendel [sic] the Mariner, who became a star, and his journeyings. For many months Tolkien was
                    kept in boring suspense in England, mainly in Staffordshire. Finally it appeared that he must soon
                    embark for France, and he and Edith married in Warwick on 22 March 1916.</p>
