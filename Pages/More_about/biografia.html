                <h3>Who is Tolkien?</h3>
                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major philologist of the English language, specialising
                    in Old and Middle English. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of
                    Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within
                    the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of
                    Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close
                    friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was
                    appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.</p>
                <p> He also wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the
                    Rings (1954–1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world which he
                    called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves,
                    Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. </p>
                <p>After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's
                    extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The
                    Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories,
                    invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it,
                    Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of
                    these writings.</p>

                <h3>Childhood and Youth:</h3>
                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later
                    annexed by the British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa). His father
                    was Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his mother was Mabel, née
                    Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein
                    office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary
                    Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.</p>
                <p>The name “Tolkien” (pron.: Tol-keen; equal stress on both syllables) was believed by the family
                    (including Tolkien himself) to be of German origin; Toll-kühn: foolishly brave, or stupidly
                    clever—hence the pseudonym “Oxymore” which he occasionally used; however, this quite probably was a
                    German rationalisation of an originally Baltic Tolkyn, or Tolkīn.</p>
                <p>As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have
                    been later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special
                    hatred of spiders as an adult.</p>
                <p>When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a
                    lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could
                    join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her
                    parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall
                    Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring
                    Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire
                    scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and
                    Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his
                    fiction.</p>
                <p>Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen
                    pupil.[15] She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and
                    feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were
                    those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.</p>
                <p>Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her
                    Baptist family, <u>which stopped all financial assistance to her</u>. From then on, both Ronald and
                    Hilary remained devout Catholics throughout their lives. Mabel Tolkien assigned the guardianship
                    of her sons to her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was
                    assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien
                    recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class
                    Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was not. I first
                    learned charity and forgiveness from him.</p>
                <p>Tolkien family life was generally lived on the genteel side of poverty. However, the situation
                    worsened in 1904, when his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal; J.R.R.Tolkien
                    was 12. After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham
                    and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St Philip's School. In 1903, he won a
                    Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's.</p>
                <p>By this time Ronald was already showing remarkable linguistic gifts. He had mastered the Latin and
                    Greek which was the staple fare of an arts education at that time, and was becoming more than
                    competent in a number of other languages, both modern and ancient, notably Gothic, and later
                    Finnish. He was already busy making up his own languages, purely for fun. He had also made a number
                    of close friends at King Edward’s; Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and Christopher Wiseman;
                    together they formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club
                    and Barrovian Society, named after their meeting place at the Barrow Stores) and they continued to
                    correspond closely and exchange and criticise each other’s literary work until 1916.</p>
                <p>Amongst the lodgers at Mrs Faulkner’s boarding house was a young woman called Edith Bratt. When
                    Ronald was 16, and she 19, they struck up a friendship, which gradually deepened. Eventually Father
                    Francis took a hand, and forbade Ronald to see or even correspond with Edith for three years, until
                    he was 21. Ronald stoically obeyed this injunction to the letter.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1911, he was invited to join a party on a walking holiday in Switzerland, which may
                    have inspired his descriptions of the Misty Mountains, and of Rivendell.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of that year he went up to Exeter College, Oxford where he stayed, immersing himself in
                    the Classics, Old English, the Germanic languages (especially Gothic), Welsh and Finnish, until
                    1913, when he swiftly though not without difficulty picked up the threads of his relationship with
                    Edith. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile the relationship with Edith was going more smoothly. She converted to Catholicism and moved
                    to Warwick, which with its spectacular castle and beautiful surrounding countryside made a great
                    impression on Ronald. However, as the pair were becoming ever closer, the nations were striving ever
                    more furiously together, and war eventually broke out in August 1914.</p>

                <h3>The Great War:</h3>
                <p>Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Tolkien did not rush to join up immediately on the outbreak of
                    war, but returned to Oxford, where he worked hard and finally achieved a first-class degree in June
                    1915. At this time he was also working on various poetic attempts, and on his invented languages,
                    especially one that he came to call Qenya [sic], which was heavily influenced by Finnish—but he
                    still felt the lack of a connecting thread to bring his vivid but disparate imaginings together.</p>
                <p>Tolkien finally enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers whilst working on ideas
                    of Earendel [sic] the Mariner, who became a star, and his journeyings. For many months Tolkien was
                    kept in boring suspense in England, mainly in Staffordshire. Finally it appeared that he must soon
                    embark for France, and he and Edith married in Warwick on 22 March 1916.</p>
                <p>Eventually he was indeed sent to active duty on the Western Front, just in time for the Somme
                    offensive. Tolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at
                    Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient.
                    Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door
                    might carry news of her husband's death.</p>
                <p>After four months in and out of the trenches, he succumbed to “trench fever”, a form of
                    typhus-like infection common in the insanitary conditions, and in early November was sent back to
                    England, where he spent the next month in hospital in Birmingham. By Christmas he had recovered
                    sufficiently to stay with Edith at Great Haywood in Staffordshire.</p>
                <p>Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the
                    Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men
                    in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the
                    battle, when a German artillery shell landed on a first-aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost
                    completely wiped out following his return to England.</p>
                <p>During these last few months, all but one of his close friends of the “T. C. B. S.” had been killed
                    in action. Partly as an act of piety to their memory, but also stirred by reaction against his war
                    experiences, he had already begun to put his stories into shape.
                    This ordering of his imagination developed into the Book of Lost Tales (not published in his
                    lifetime), in which most of the major stories of the Silmarillion appear in their first form: tales
                    of the Elves and the “Gnomes”, (i. e. Deep Elves, the later Noldor), with their languages Qenya and
                    Goldogrin. Here are found the first recorded versions of the wars against Morgoth, the siege and
                    fall of Gondolin and Nargothrond, and the tales of Túrin and of Beren and Lúthien.</p>
                <p>According to his children John and Priscilla Tolkien, "In later years, he would occasionally talk of
                    being at the front: of the horrors of the first German gas attack, of the utter exhaustion and
                    ominous quiet after a bombardment, of the whining scream of the shells, and the endless marching,
                    always on foot, through a devastated landscape, sometimes carrying the men's equipment as well as
                    his own to encourage them to keep going. ... Some remarkable relics survive from that time: a trench
                    map he drew himself; pencil-written orders to carry bombs to the 'fighting line.</p>
                <p>Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, although periods of remission enabled him to do
                    home service at various camps sufficiently well to be promoted to lieutenant. It was when he was
                    stationed in the Hull area that he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and there in
                    a
                    grove thick with hemlock Edith danced for him. This was the inspiration for the tale of Beren and
                    Lúthien, a recurrent theme in his “Legendarium”. He came to think of Edith as “Lúthien” and himself
                    as
                    “Beren”. Their first son, John Francis Reuel (later Father John Tolkien) had already been born on 16
                    November 1917.</p>

                <img src="../../Assets/Images/Academic.jpg" alt="Tolkien studying">
                <h3>Academic and writing career: </h3>
                <p>On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.[61]
                    His first civilian job after World War I was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where he worked
                    mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W.[62] In
                    1920, he took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds, becoming the
                    youngest member of the academic staff there.</p>
                <p>In 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship
                    at Pembroke College. In a sense, in returning to Oxford as a Professor, Tolkien had come home.
                    Although he had few illusions about the academic life as a haven of unworldly scholarship (see for
                    example Letters 250), he was nevertheless by temperament a don’s don, and fitted extremely well into
                    the largely male world of teaching, research, the comradely exchange of ideas and occasional
                    publication. In fact, his academic publication record is very sparse, something that would have been
                    frowned upon in these days of quantitative personnel evaluation. </p>
                <p>However, his rare scholarly publications were often extremely influential, most notably his lecture
                    “Beowulf, the Monsters and the Critics”. His academic life was otherwise largely unremarkable. In
                    1945 he changed his chair to the Merton Professorship of English Language and Literature, which he
                    retained until his retirement in 1959. Apart from all the above, he taught undergraduates, and
                    played an important but unexceptional part in academic politics and administration.</p>

                <img src="../../Assets/Images/The_Hobbit.jpg" alt="A copy of The Hobbit" id="hobbit">
                <h3>The storyteller:</h3>
                <p>Meanwhile Tolkien continued developing his mythology and languages. As mentioned above, he told his
                    children stories, some of which he developed into those published posthumously as Mr. Bliss,
                    Roverandom, etc. However, according to his own account, one day when he was engaged in the
                    soul-destroying task of marking examination papers, he discovered that one candidate had left one
                    page of an answer-book blank. On this page, moved by who knows what anarchic daemon, he wrote “In a
                    hole in the ground there lived a hobbit“.</p>
                <p>In typical Tolkien fashion, he then decided he needed to find out what a Hobbit was, what sort of a
                    hole it lived in, why it lived in a hole, etc. From this investigation grew a tale that he told to
                    his younger children, and even passed round. In 1936 an incomplete typescript of it came into the
                    hands of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the publishing firm of George Allen and Unwin.</p>
                <p>She asked Tolkien to finish it, and presented the complete story to Stanley Unwin, the then Chairman
                    of the firm. He tried it out on his 10-year old son Rayner, who wrote an approving report, and it
                    was published as The Hobbit in 1937. It immediately scored a success, and has not been out of
                    children’s recommended reading lists ever since. It was so successful that Stanley Unwin asked if he
                    had any more similar material available for publication.</p>
                <p>By this time Tolkien had begun to make his Legendarium into what he believed to be a more presentable
                    state, and as he later noted, hints of it had already made their way into The Hobbit. He was now
                    calling the full account Quenta Silmarillion, or Silmarillion for short. He presented some of his
                    “completed” tales to Unwin, who sent them to his reader. The reader’s reaction was mixed: dislike of
                    the poetry and praise for the prose (the material was the story of Beren and Lúthien) but the
                    overall decision at the time was that these were not commercially publishable. Unwin tactfully
                    relayed this message to Tolkien, but asked him again if he was willing to write a sequel to The
                    Hobbit. Tolkien was disappointed at the apparent failure of The Silmarillion, but agreed to take up
                    the challenge of “The New Hobbit”.</p>
                <p>This soon developed into something much more than a children’s story; for the highly complex 16-year
                    history of what became The Lord of the Rings. Suffice it to say that
                    the now adult Rayner Unwin was deeply involved in the later stages of this opus, dealing
                    magnificently with a dilatory and temperamental author who, at one stage, was offering the whole
                    work to a commercial rival (which rapidly backed off when the scale and nature of the package became
                    apparent). It is thanks to Rayner Unwin’s advocacy that we owe the fact that this book was published
                    at all – Andave laituvalmes! His father’s firm decided to incur the probable loss of £1,000 for the
                    succès d’estime, and publish it under the title of The Lord of the Rings in three parts during 1954
                    and 1955, with USA rights going to Houghton Mifflin. It soon became apparent that both author and
                    publishers had greatly underestimated the work’s public appeal.</p>
                <p>So far from losing money, sales so exceeded the break-even point as to make Tolkien regret that he
                    had not taken early retirement. However, this was still based only upon hardback sales. The really
                    amazing moment was when The Lord of the Rings went into a pirated paperback version in 1965.
                    Firstly, this put the book into the impulse-buying category; and secondly, the publicity generated
                    by the copyright dispute alerted millions of American readers to the existence of something outside
                    their previous experience, but which appeared to speak to their condition. By 1968 The Lord of the
                    Rings had almost become the Bible of the “Alternative Society”.</p>

                <h3>Family:</h3>
                <p>The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003),
                    Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien
                    (21 November 1924 – 16 January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (18 June 1929 – 28
                    February 2022).[79][80] Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters
                    from Father Christmas when they were young.</p>
                <p>His family life was equally straightforward. Edith bore their last child and only daughter,
                    Priscilla, in 1929. Tolkien got into the habit of writing the children annual illustrated letters as
                    if from Santa Claus, and a selection of these was published in 1976 as The Father Christmas Letters.
                    He also told them numerous bedtime stories, of which more anon. In adulthood John entered the
                    priesthood, Michael and Christopher both saw war service in the Royal Air Force. Afterwards Michael
                    became a schoolmaster and Christopher a university lecturer, and Priscilla became a social worker.
                    They lived quietly in North Oxford, and later Ronald and Edith lived in the suburb of Headington.
                </p>
                <p>His son Christopher became his main editor. The long-awaited Silmarillion, appeared in 1977. In 1980
                    Christopher also published a selection of his father’s incomplete
                    writings from his later years under the title of Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In
                    the introduction to this work Christopher Tolkien referred in passing to The Book of Lost Tales,
                    “itself a very substantial work, of the utmost interest to one concerned with the origins of
                    Middle-earth, but requiring to be presented in a lengthy and complex study, if at all” (Unfinished
                    Tales, p. 6, paragraph 1).</p>
                <p>After his retirement in 1959 Edith and Ronald moved to Bournemouth. On 29 November 1971 Edith died,
                    and Ronald soon returned to Oxford, to rooms provided by Merton College. Ronald died on 2 September
                    1973. He and Edith are buried together in a single grave in the Catholic section of Wolvercote
                    cemetery in the northern suburbs of Oxford. (The grave is well signposted from the entrance.) The
                    legend on the headstone reads:</p>
                <blockquote><b>Edith Mary Tolkien, Lúthien, 1889–1971</b></blockquote>
                <blockquote><b>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren, 1892–1973</b></blockquote>
