        <h2>The war of the last Alliance:</h2>
        <p>The War of the Last Alliance was fought by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men against the Dark Lord Sauron in
            response to his threat of conquest. It lasted for twelve years and had four distinct stages.</p>
        <p>The conjoined army of Elves under Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor, King Oropher of the Woodland Realm and
            King Amdír of Lothlórien joined with Elendil's host from Arnor and Gondor to create the most significant
            force assembled in Middle-earth since the landing of Ar-Pharazôn. The Last Alliance was the largest military
            union of the Free Peoples of the world, and the only large-scale war fought until the climax of the War of
            the Ring an age later. After this war, the Elves of Middle-earth could never muster a force of this strength
            again.</p>
        <p>Durin IV, King of Durin's Folk during the War of the Last Alliance, sent an army of Dwarves of Khazad-dûm to
            fight alongside the Last Alliance of Elves and Men in the battles. It is said that very few Dwarves fought
            on either side, but the Longbeards fought alongside the Last Alliance.</p>

                <h3>Prelude:</h3>
                <p>Having been weakened in the Downfall of Númenor it took Sauron some time to rebuild his physical
                    form. Once he had done so he became aware that Elendil had survived the Downfall and that his sons
                    Isildur and Anárion had founded a realm next to Mordor itself. Determined to crush the Númenórean
                    exiles before their realms could take root, Sauron launched a surprise attack on Minas Ithil in SA
                    3429, taking the city and burning the White Tree of Gondor.</p>
                <p>However he struck before his own power was fully rebuilt and in his absence the power of Gil-galad
                    had grown stronger, even drawing nigh to Mordor itself. While Anárion defended Osgiliath, Isildur
                    sailed north to Arnor to take counsel with Elendil. Realising that they had sufficient power to
                    strike back, Elendil and Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, with the aim of
                    putting an end to Sauron for good.</p>
                <p>Because Elendil and Gil-galad had taken the initiative, they had the luxury of time to prepare for
                    the coming battles. Both kings spent two years gathering their forces; Elendil and Isildur met
                    Gil-galad at the watchtower of Amon Sûl on Weathertop, and together they led their hosts to
                    Rivendell, where they were joined by Elrond and his company of Elves. In Rivendell, they spent a
                    further three years making plans, forging weapons, and training for the great battle ahead of them.
                    This was the reason Rivendell was also known as "The Great Forge".</p>

                <h3>The battle of Dagorlad:</h3>
                <img src="../../Assets/Images/Elf-in-Dead-Marshes.jpg" alt="A dead elf in the Dead Marshes">
                <p>Crossing the Misty Mountains, they journeyed south down the River Anduin, gathering Elves led by
                    Oropher and Amdír, the kings of Greenwood and Lórien, respectively, and eventually were joined by
                    the army of Gondor led by Isildur's brother Anárion and an army of Dwarves of Khazad-dûm.</p>
                <p>The decisive battle took place before Mordor, on the plains of Dagorlad. It was here when the Last
                    Alliance destroyed Sauron's main force. Although this was a victory, many were lost, including both
                    kings Amdír and Oropher, due to their annoyance at following the supreme command of Gil-galad, the
                    High King of the Ñoldor, and thus charging prematurely at the enemy. Many
                    Silvan Elves were also
                    killed alongside Oropher, and so were many Elves and Men. Many of Oropher's army fell in the face of
                    the Black Gate, but Amdír and his army were driven back all the way to the Dead Marshes, where they
                    were slain bitterly. The bodies of these Elves stayed preserved in the Marshes up until Frodo and
                    Sam passed with Gollum.</p>
                <p>This battle raged for days and nights continuously. But the Elves were still mighty in these times
                    and the Númenóreans were tall and strong and terrible. And none could withstand Aeglos and Narsil,
                    Gil-galad's spear and Elendil's sword which filled the orcs and wicked men with fear. Slowly Elves
                    and Númenóreans whittled down the vast numbers of Orcs and pushed them back towards the Black
                    Gate. No account is given how the Alliance managed to break through this mighty fortification
                    though.</p>

                <h3>The Siege of Barad-dûr:</h3>
                <img src="../../Assets/Images/Siege_BaradDur.webp" alt="The Siege of Barad-dûr">
                <p>After this battle, the Black Gate was breached by the Alliance and the Siege of Barad-dûr began,
                    lasting seven years, during which Anárion, son of Elendil and King of Gondor, was killed by a rock
                    cast from Barad-dûr. Isildur's sons, Aratan and Ciryon, were detached and sent to Minas Ithil to
                    guard against a breakout to the southwest, but his oldest son, Elendur served by his side till the
                    end.</p>
                <p>The forces battled for many years and the Alliance managed to advance little by little. In the
                    seventh year of the siege, it became so pressing that Sauron himself came forth. His onslaught was
                    terrible and the siege was almost broken as Sauron and his host advanced to the slopes of Mount
                    Doom. There he was encountered by the captains of the Alliance, Gil-galad and Elendil and to their
                    side stood Elrond, Círdan and Isildur. Sauron fought with Gil-galad and Elendil, and both were
                    slain. As Elendil fell, his sword was broken beneath him. Yet Sauron was thrown down, too, and
                    Isildur seized the hilt of his father's sword and cut off the finger on which Sauron wore the One
                    Ring. Being bereft of its power, Sauron was no longer able to hold a physical form and perished.</p>

            <section id="aftermath">
                <h3>Aftermath:</h3>
                <p>The Alliance pursued the Orcs, who were then in disarray, and killed them all. The Barad-dûr was
                    levelled but its foundations remained behind since they were built with the power of the One Ring
                    which was not destroyed. The thousands of dead Men and Elves were taken out of Mordor and buried in
                    the Dagorlad Plain.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the war, which ended with the Siege of Barad-dûr in S.A. 3441, most of the Silvan
                    army had been lost. Thranduil led the remaining third of his army back home to the Greenwood.</p>
                    <img src="../../Assets/Images/Isildur.jpg" alt="Isildur was killed on the Gladden Fields">
                <p>While he had captured the One Ring, Isildur refused Elrond and Círdan's entreaties that he destroy it
                    by casting it into the Crack of Doom, claiming it as a weregild for his father's and brother's
                    death. The result of this was that while Sauron was defeated and cast down, his spirit was not
                    destroyed. He hid in the dark lands east of Mordor, and slowly rebuilt his power. The Nine (Nazgûl)
                    also bided their time for the day when he would rise again.</p>
                <p>While the Orc armies of Sauron had been well nigh destroyed in the War, scattered groups of them
                    survived. In the Last Alliance, the casualties had been heavy. Elendil and Anárion were gone, and
                    Gil-galad, last High King of the Noldor, was no more. Arnor took grievous losses, and suffered from
                    a decline in population. It never really recovered as a major power and broke into three pieces some
                    centuries later. Gondor suffered less heavily and became a powerful nation. Isildur, the new High
                    King of Arnor, perished only two years later in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, along with his
                    three older sons. They were ambushed by an Orc task force operating near the River Anduin. In the
                    course of Isildur's death, the Ring was lost in the depths of Anduin. Much was lost, but Sauron
                    was suppressed- for a while.</p>
