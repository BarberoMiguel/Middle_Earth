        <h2>Battles:</h2>
        <p>In this chapter we explore the diferent battles that take place in the Lord of the Rings and in the
            Hobbit in cronological order. Those are: the war of the Last Alliance, the Battle of the 5 Armies,
            the battle of Helm's Deep, the Siege of Gondor and the Battle of the Morannon. In each battle we
            will describe who took part in it, how the battle developed, who won and aproximate losses in both
            sides.</p>

                <h3>The war of the last Alliance:</h3>
                <img src="../../Assets/Images/Elrond2.webp" alt="The war of the last Alliance" class="smaller">
                <p>The War of the Last Alliance was fought by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men against the Dark Lord
                    Sauron in
                    response to his threat of conquest. It lasted for twelve years and had four distinct stages.</p>
                <p>The conjoined army of Elves under Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor, King Oropher of the Woodland
                    Realm and
                    King Amdír of Lothlórien joined with Elendil's host from Arnor and Gondor to create the most
                    significant
                    force assembled in Middle-earth since the landing of Ar-Pharazôn. The Last Alliance was the largest
                    military
                    union of the Free Peoples of the world, and the only large-scale war fought until the climax of the
                    War of
                    the Ring an age later. After this war, the Elves of Middle-earth could never muster a force of this
                    strength
                    again.</p>

                <p>The Battle of Five Armies was a battle waged between the Orcs and the Wargs of the Misty Mountains
                    and the
                    Grey Mountains against the Lake-men, Elves, Dwarves, on and near the Lonely Mountain.</p>
                <p>After Bard killed the dragon Smaug, the Men of the Lake and the Wood-elves both laid siege to the
                    Dwarves
                    in the Lonely Mountain, the thirteen Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain under Thorin II Oakenshield
                    having
                    refused to share any of the treasure that they had recaptured from Smaug.</p>

                <p>The Battle of the Hornburg, known in various adaptations as the Battle of Helm's Deep, was the first
                    large-scale battle of the War of the Ring, where the Rohirrim under King Théoden defended the
                    Hornburg from
                    Saruman's army of Dunlendings and Uruk-hai.</p>

                <h3>The Siege of Gondor:</h3>
                <img src="../../Assets/Images/Siege_of_Gondor.webp" alt="The Siege of Gondor">
                <p>The Siege of Minas Tirith, also known as the Siege of Gondor, occurred in the year TA 3019 when
                    Sauron's army
                    besieged the city of Minas Tirith during the Great War of the Ring. The siege, though nearly
                    successful, was
                    broken by the arrival of Théoden and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.</p>
                <p>The Battle of the Pelennor Fields was a battle for the city of Minas Tirith and ultimately Gondor,
                    immediately following a large-scale siege of Minas Tirith by Sauron's army. It was the greatest
                    battle of the Great War of the Ring and indeed the largest of the entire Third Age. Major casualties
                    resulted, including the deaths of King Théoden and the Witch-king of Angmar.</p>

                <img src="../../Assets/Images/westForces_surrounded.webp" alt="The battle of the Morannon">
                <p>The Battle of the Black Gate or Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle of the War of the Ring,
                    fought before Mordor's Black Gate. It resulted in the ultimate defeat of Sauron not by victory on the
                    battlefield, but by means of the destruction of the One Ring by the Hobbit Frodo Baggins.</p>
